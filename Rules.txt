• Goal #1

Build a Java app that, at its most basic, consumes an inbound real-time stream of data , is able to perform some processing on it, and then pass the data back out to another receiving stream.


• Goal #2

The app needs to handle that it can handle 20,000 messages per second, performing some transformation on the inbound data, to produce a different data structure on the outbound stream.


• Goal #3

The app needs to produce metrics from line handling and transformation latencies from data arrival, through processing, to delivery to outbound stream.
